Display a responsive and custom warning banner and disable cookies when users enter your website until you obtain their consent.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[Our module fully complies with the European Cookie Law.  Complete compliance with the law  Besides displaying a warning banner, our module is the only one that allows you to block the cookies when users enter your store. As established by the law, you "shall ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information."  Please note that all the other cookie modules sold on Addons only allows you to display a warning banner regardless of the user consent. Cookies are installed on the users' computer without obtaining their consent and regardless of their will.  Main features of the modulesDisplay a warning banner on every page to inform users about the use of cookies and ask for their consentDisable a list of modules when users enter the website because warning users about cookies is useless and illegal if you have already installed cookies on their computer.Enable these cookies after having obtained their consent or maintain them disabled if they refuse.Fully customize the warning banner (color, text, link, font, position, multilingual mode, transparency, buttons...) Getting the user consent   The module includes 2 different ways to ask user consent, you can choose between:Acceptance through a button: Users must click on the "I accept" button in the warning banner to give his consent. As soon as users give their consent, the warning banner disappears and all the modules using cookies will get enabled and will work as usual. But if users refuse to give their consent, the disabled modules will remain disabled. We recommend you to use this mode, this one allows you to fully comply with the law.Acceptance through the navigation: If users continue browsing the website, they will accept the use of cookies. The warning banner is displayed on the first page on which users arrive with a message like « By continuing browsing the website, you accept the use of cookies ». As soon as users decide to go to another page, the banner automatically disappears and the disabled modules will get enabled.Note: the consent remains valid during the period of time set in the module interface (we recommend you not to go over 13 months)  Customizing the banner content and design  As recommended by the European authority, the module allows you to customize the warning message inside the banner (to inform users about the cookies users and their purpose) and add a "More information" button into the banner that take users to a CMS page of your store (to explain in details the use of cookies on your store).  The warning banner is responsive and will always be displayed full-width. The module comes with a Wysiwyg editor that allows you to fully customize the content of the banner (font, color, effects, html code, links...). You can also choose from the configuration page the background color of the banner, its percentage of opacity (transparency) and its position (top or bottom of the page). Moreover, the module is multilingual and automatically detects all the languages of your store, which allows you to set a different warning message per language.  Note: the module is designed to not display a warning message when search engines robots crawl you store in order not to affect your SEO.  Disabling the modules that use cookies  This is the only module that allows you to choose the modules/cookies that you want to disable until users give their consent. This feature is compulsory because it is useless and illegal to inform users if you have already installed cookies on their computer with their consent.  "Member States shall ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information, in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC” EU Cookie Law  To comply with the directive of the EU Cookie Law, we recommend you to disable the tracking (Google Analytics), social sharing (Facebook " Like ", Google " +1 ", etc.) and targeted advertising modules. Please note that all modules that are required for the good running of your PrestaShop store (ex: basket cookie, session cookie...) don't require any consents.  Multistore mode  The module is compatible with multistore and allows you to display the same notification banner on each one of your shop but the consent is the same for all shops. If you accept the use of cookies on one of your shop, the module will consider that you accept the use of cookies for all your other shops (mention it on your cookie policy) and the notification banner will not be shown when you go to your other shops.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[administration]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.4.8]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.5.0.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.0.3]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[29.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[34.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[25.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Partner Agency"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/ps-partner-agency.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/689395-pprod/eu-cookie-law-notification-banner-cookie-blocker.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/689395-pbig/eu-cookie-law-notification-banner-cookie-blocker.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[8741]]></id><name><![CDATA[dmulistecommandes]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[DMU Improved Order List]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Order Management]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Save time on the processing of your orders!

Think of how long it takes to receive an order from your customers, process the order by adding the products to the package, then connect to your shipping carrier`s software and manually insert the customer information, parcel information and delivery address for the order, for each order at a time. This is very time consuming and it`s very easy to make mistakes because you have a lot of data to process.  With this module all of this is done automatically via the API (Application Programming Interface) that connects the orders section in prestashop with the carrier and instantly sends the information to the carrier, then prints the shipping label which is then slicked to the package.

Turn your visitors into subscribers! &nbsp; Improve the subscription rate for your shop:  Pop-ins are effective at attracting visitors&rsquo; attention, gaining more clicks than sliders, banners or sign-up panels in the footer (which have a conversion rate of only 0.05%). The proven results for this tool show increases of between 20% and 1,000% in your subscription rate. &nbsp; Turn your subscribers into loyal customers: Offer them a discount voucher for their next purchase in your shop to thank them for subscribing. &nbsp; Offer a flawless user experience: Similar to pop-ups but with an improved user experience, pop-ins integrate perfectly with the page where they appear. Pop Newsletter applies best practices recommended for this advertising method:Lightbox effectOption to close the module window with a simple click outside the pop-in, as well as a cross symbol button for closure in the top right-hand corner.Option to specify when the pop-in is activated. This allows your visitor to get to know your site before seeing the pop-in.Once your visitor closes the pop-in, it will not be shown again.Adaptable to all types of shop, with no need for programming or graphic design skills.&nbsp; &nbsp; Improve results from your newsletters by increasing your contact base: Thanks to the optional newsletter sign-up form, you can analyse and classify your subscribers more effectively. Pop Newsletter also allows you to send a confirmation e-mail to the e-mail address provided by your subscriber to ensure there is no chance of your newsletter being sent to an incorrect address.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[front_office_features]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.3.1]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.0.3]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[59.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[69.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[44.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Made by PrestaShop"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/made-by-prestashop.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/722395-pprod/pop-newsletter-popup.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias3.prestastore.com/722395-pbig/pop-newsletter-popup.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[21510]]></id><name><![CDATA[popexit]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Pop Exit - Retargeting onsite Popup]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Pop-in & Pop-up]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Make a pop-up appear when your visitors are about to leave your site, and encourage them to complete their order!

Your customers find this compulsory and repetitive step annoying and frustrating. Some customers give up and go to another site where they know they have already entered all their information. What is more, shipping errors caused by customers entering their addresses incorrectly are not uncommon, entailing additional transport costs and decreased customer satisfaction owing to the delays caused by their parcels being sent out and returned again.  Easy Places is the ultimate solution for avoiding such problems! It allows you to offer your clients an elegant, high performance technical solution to make your account creation forms more pleasant to fill in.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[checkout]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.0.3]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.5.0.17]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.0.3]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[39.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[44.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[34.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Partner Agency"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/ps-partner-agency.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/766068-pprod/easy-places.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/766068-pbig/easy-places.jpg]]></big></cover></module></modules>
