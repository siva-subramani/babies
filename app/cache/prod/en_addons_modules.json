You can also choose from the configuration page the background color of the banner, its percentage of opacity (transparency) and its position (top or bottom of the page). Moreover, the module is multilingual and automatically detects all the languages of your store, which allows you to set a different warning message per language.<br \/><br \/>Note: the module is designed to not display a warning message when search engines robots crawl you store in order not to affect your SEO.<br \/><br \/><u><strong>Disabling the modules that use cookies<\/strong><\/u><br \/><br \/>This is the only module that allows you to choose the modules\/cookies that you want to disable until users give their consent.
